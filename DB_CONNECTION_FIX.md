# Database Connection Fix

## Changes Made

1. **Enhanced DB Connection Handling**:
   - Updated `backend/config/db.js` to handle connection failures gracefully
   - Added better error messages for MongoDB connection issues
   - Created a fallback to mock data when MongoDB isn't available

2. **Improved Environment Configuration**:
   - Modified `backend/server.js` to auto-create the `.env` file if missing
   - Added a health check endpoint at `/api/health` to monitor service status

3. **Created Mock Data**:
   - Updated `backend/routes/jobs.js` to provide mock job data
   - This ensures the API returns useful data even without MongoDB

4. **Fixed Authentication**:
   - Updated `backend/middleware/authMiddleware.js` for development
   - Removed token requirements that would block API access during testing

5. **Added Diagnostic Tools**:
   - Created `check-mongodb.js` to verify MongoDB installation and connection
   - Added `check-app-connection.js` to test backend API connectivity
   - Provided detailed troubleshooting guides

## How to Use the Fixed Application

1. **Start the Backend**:
   ```
   cd backend
   node server.js
   ```

2. **Start the Frontend**:
   ```
   cd frontend
   npm start
   ```

3. **Verify Connectivity**:
   - Open your browser to http://localhost:3000
   - The jobs should now load from the API
   - If using mock data, you'll still see the jobs but changes won't persist

## Next Steps

1. **For Production Use**:
   - Install MongoDB following the instructions in `MONGODB_INSTALLATION_GUIDE.md`
   - Configure proper authentication in the backend
   - Add real database models for jobs, users, and resumes

2. **For Testing/Development**:
   - The current setup allows using the app with mock data
   - All API endpoints will return test data without requiring MongoDB

## Troubleshooting

If you still encounter connection issues:

1. Check if the backend server is running (http://localhost:5000/api/health)
2. Verify the frontend proxy configuration in `frontend/package.json`
3. Look for any CORS errors in the browser console
4. Try restarting both servers
